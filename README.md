# CustomDrawMode

This is a simple tool designed for technical artists. It extends and customizes the Draw Mode of the Unity3D Scene window. 

You can view a model's base color, metallic, smoothness, roughness, ambient occlusion (AO), normals, emissive, vertex colors, grayscale, UV0, and UV1 in the Scene viewport. 

The tool supports both the built-in rendering pipeline and the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).
